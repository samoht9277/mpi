# mpi
An all-in-one ``make`` script for tweak compiling. 


### How to use:
1- Download the file, make sure that its an executable; to do that simply run ``chmod +x /path/to/mpi``

2- Open the script with a text editor and type the path of the folder where you store all your projects (line [21](https://github.com/samoht9277/mpi/blob/5d262994809c5234e353fdc7c45aafcade8f92e0/mpi#L21))

3- Now, put the script in the following directory:

* **for macOS**: /usr/local/bin

* **for Linux/WSL/Cygwin/macOS without SIP**: /usr/bin

4- Run!
